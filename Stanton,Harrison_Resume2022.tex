\subsection*{GLM for Machine Learning Technique Prediction}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5em}{0pt}
	\textit{University of Nevada, Reno, Fall 2017 - 2018}
	\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5em}{0pt}
Programmed a machine learning classifier ensemble. A large set of datasets were then trained through the ensemble and generated higher order data.  This ensemble data was used to create a generalized linear model to predict accuracy of different classifiers based off of specific extracted attributes of the data set. For example, does the distribution of the dataset have an effect on what classifiers perform well?
